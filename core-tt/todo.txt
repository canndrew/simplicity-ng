# TODO

* Make substitution more efficient by not needlessly growing the filter to
  cover the entire term being substituted.
  It only needs to cover the prefix before the variable index.

* Run clippy to find unnecessary clones (and anything else).

* Remove the need to explicitly call weaken_into when using the high-level api.
    have a thread-local var that stores the current context.
    can then move a lot of the methods off of context for creating types/terms
    to just being static inherent methods on Ty/Tm.
    The problem with this though is that it prevents writing parallel code
    using scoped threads (eg. rayon).

* Fix stack overflows for operations on very large trees by replacing recursion with loops.
